##Run DistributedShell With a Shell Command

##Launch the YARN job using the yarn command
yarn jar /opt/mapr/hadoop/hadoop-2.7.0/share/hadoop/yarn/hadoop-yarn-applications-distributedshell-2.7.0-mapr-1506.jar \
-shell_command /bin/ls \
-shell_args /user/user01 \
-jar /opt/mapr/hadoop/hadoop-2.7.0/share/hadoop/yarn/hadoop-yarn-applications-distributedshell-2.7.0-mapr-1506.jar

##When the job completes, scroll back through the output to determine your container ID for the shell
##Submitted application application_1439440834683_0003

##Check Standard Output and Standard Error for Job

#Change directory to the output directory for YARN jobs
cd /opt/mapr/hadoop/hadoop-2.7.0/logs/userlogs

#List the contents of the directory
ls

#Change directory to your application output directory
cd application_1439440834683_0003

#Change directory to the second container output directory
cd container_e02_1439440834683_0003_01_000002

#Display the contents of the stdout file. You should see a listing of the /user/user01 directory
cat stdout

#Display the contents of the stderr file. It should be empty.
cat stderr

##Copy the Lab Files
1. Create a directory as follows
mkdir /user/user01/3

2. Copy the source code from your laptop into that directory
scp -P 2222 /Users/gangadharkadam/Downloads/DEV_301_COURSE_MATERIALS/COURSE_FILES/DEV301LABFILESV410/RECEIPTS_LAB.zip user01@localhost:/user/user01/3

3. Change directory into the directory. 
cd /user/user01/3

4. Unzip the RECEIPTS_LAB.zip file. 
unzip RECEIPTS_LAB.zip

##Exercise 3.2: Modify Code in the Driver
1.Change directory into the RECEIPTS_LAB directory. 
cd /user/user01/3/RECEIPTS_LAB

2. Open the ReceiptsDriver.java source file with your favorite text editor.
vi ReceiptsDriver.java

3. Make the following changes to the driver
//TODO Change the name of the job to a string of your choice
HINT: Change the string “my receipts” to any string of your choice
//TODO Comment out the Reducer definition
HINT: The reducer is defined by the setReducerClass() method of the Job object
4. Save the ReceiptsDriver.java file.
